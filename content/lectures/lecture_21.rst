Lecture 21 - Amplifiers : Part 2
================================

**Date:** 11/1/16

Summary
-------
We will continue our discussion of amplifying small signals. We will go over the
integrator, differentiator, and summing amplifier circuits. We will also show
how to design a multivibrator circuit. Finally, we will introduce the
instrumentation amplifier and go over some common problems encountered with
using amplifiers in the laboratory.

Class Plan
