Lecture 24 - ADC/DAC
====================

**Date:** 11/10/16

Summary
-------
We have already talked about the digital representation of voltage and even used
an analog-to-digital converter to measure voltages with the Arduino. In this
class we’re going to dive into how analog-to-digital converters work and the
advantages of different converter architectures. We will also introduce
digital-to-analog conversion – generating a voltage from a digital
representation.
